# Telegram Streak Bot

A Telegram bot that helps groups stay accountable by tracking daily workout streaks using `+` or `++` messages and daily quests completions using unique hashtag for each quest. It motivates users, reacts to their streak updates and quest completions, and reminds inactive members with daily motivational quotes.
